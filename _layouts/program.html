							<div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> 
								Inviwo is a rapid prototyping framework for visualizing spatial and abstract data. In this tutorial, 
								we show how Inviwo can be utilized for easily creating visualizations in the biomedical domain. 
								We provide an overview of the concepts used in Inviwo like its visual network editor and the associated data flow paradigm. 
								Several hands-on examples illustrate how to import data and build your own visualization networks. 
								The tutorial is tailored to beginners – no prior experience with the framework is necessary.
								Inviwo is available at <a href="https://inviwo.org">https://inviwo.org</a> and <a href="https://github.com/inviwo/inviwo">Github</a>.

							<div class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> 
								 Data visualization is a proven means to engage with, explore, and contextualize large volumes of information critical 
								 to decision making. However, many questions must be answered to create a visualization, such as: What color should I 
								 use for this variable? or should I use a bar- or line-chart to find something? Poor decisions may produce visualizations 
								 that mislead, hide, or overstate important features of the data, while good decisions result in clear, more honest 
								 depictions of the data. In this hands-on tutorial, we will introduce the basics of visualization design using the 
								 Python <a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/">Vega-Altair</a> library.

								One of the best things about summer schools is meeting new people. We hope that this one 
								will not be an exception. The school is open to attendees with diverse expertise/interest areas spanning biology, medicine, and visualization.
							   This means there is a unique opportunity to learn from one another, look at the research activities from different perspectives, and 
								maybe even build future collaborations. In this session, you will get a chance to discuss with fellow
								summer school attendees and find out how research is done in their research group, what problems do they encounter, and how are they approaching them.
							</br>
							
							Note: Since the nature of this session strongly depends on the expertise/interest areas of the attendees, it is subject to change. We will tailor the contents of the session 
							and activities to the profile of registered attendees.
