He received his PhD degree from the Technical University of Vienna, working in the fields of medical visualization and real-time volume rendering. In his current position, he aims to integrate advanced rendering and visualization methods into ultrasound systems deployed in clinical environments.",andrej-varchola.jpg,alexey-karimov.jpg,,,,"Ultrasound imaging has always been a special case in the medical domain, given that it delivers images in real-time. This combined with characteristic noise and artifacts poses a challenge to producing clinically relevant data. The newest AI algorithms come here to aid the decision process with detection, labeling, assisted navigation, and report generation. As anatomical models of heart structures are inferred and available in real time, the need for advanced visualization techniques arises. Volume rendering alone does not suffice the requirements of the field, because many more data elements are present. Seamless integration of mesh models, measurement results, and inferred anatomical labels and features are expected from the upcoming generation of rendering/visualization pipelines in ultrasound."
