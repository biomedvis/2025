Following the paradigm of online education during COVID-19 pandemic, we are starting an initiative across institutions for an educational Bio+Med+Vis platform. The purpose is to build a growing curriculum that will bridge the domains of biological, medical, and biomedical visualization. Study materials from diverse fields in Bio+Med+Vis will be collected at different levels of detail and with varying required preliminary knowledge. 

As a starting point, we are organizing a Bio+Med+Vis School, which will offer a set of talks on various visualization subjects from prestigious and established Bio+Med+Vis researchers, addressing different life sciences domains. This is a unique opportunity for students to meet experts from all facets of our field.
